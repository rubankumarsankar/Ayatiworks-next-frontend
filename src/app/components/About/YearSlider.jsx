With the momentum building, our team expanded to 20 passionate professionals, ready to make waves and reshape the digital world.`,
  },
  2020: {
    title: "The Year We Hoped and Hustled",
    text: `The Year We Hoped and Hustled was when challenges met resilience. Even as COVID and lockdowns tested the world, Ayatiworks refused to lose momentum. Our team grew from 10 to 15 strong, and so did our client family, with brands like Nova Life Space, Vels Group, Indian Terrain, Royal Enfield, and Benelli joining us. 2020 had already fueled our optimism, crowning us Best Brand of Tamil Nadu, and in 2021 we turned that hope into hustle-driven growth.`,
  },
  2019: {
    title: "The Year We Leveled Up",
    text: `If 2018 was a win, 2019 was a boss battle! Big names like Xiaomi, Siva Hospitals, Dr. Cecy, and Hyundai joined our roster, proving our digital magic was spot on. But wait, there’s more! We created our very own learning management system for the Singapore Government (yep, we went BIG). And our team? Grew to 10 legends ready to take on the world!`,
  },
  2018: {
    title: "The Year We Went Global (And Doubled Up!)",
    text: `The Year We Went Global (and Doubled Up!) was a milestone worth celebrating. Turning one felt incredible as Ayatiworks moved from supporting local legends to landing our very first overseas client, schools in Singapore, who trusted us with ROI-driven campaigns. Our team quickly grew from 2 to 6, and new partnerships with Pettikadai, Vinayak Motors, and Noritake made 2018 a year of promise, progress, and powerful wins that set the stage for global growth.`,
  },
  2017: {
    title: "The Year We Went from Zero to Zoom!",
    text: `The Year We Went from Zero to Zoom was where it all began. What started with two dreamers and a bold idea quickly turned into something bigger. We began by helping small brands and startups find their digital footing, and soon larger names like Kesavardhini and Syscom came knocking for our digital magic. With offbeat strategies and fresh energy, we didn’t just help them grow, we propelled their digital sales into the stratosphere.`,
